    "Carmilla grumbles and drags her feet through the nearly two feet of snow that covers the path leading away from Silas University."
    carm "I still can't believe I have to drink animal blood."
    laura "Carmilla, would you please stop whining? We have worse things to worry about than your refined blood palette."
    carm "We certainly do. We're fleeing the campus into the unknown Styrian wilderness with absolutely no plan and no idea where we’re going."
    carm "Not to mention the animal blood."

    laura "Hey, I DO have a plan!"
    carm "And your previous plans have been {i}so very well prepared{/i}."
    "I blush furiously, stuttering."
    laura "W-well, I, I was - well. Okay, well maybe I don’t have a complete plan, but I promise, everything's going to be fine."
    perry "I have a bad feeling about this..."
    laura "Honestly, it'll be fine - I mean, what could go wrong?"
