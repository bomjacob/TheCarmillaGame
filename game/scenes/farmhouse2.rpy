    "We walk for what feels like hours and hours, trudging through the snow."
    
    carm "That nice, warm farmhouse is sounding nice right about now, isn’t it?"
    laura "This is really not the time for sarcasm, Carm, especially when I can’t feel any of my extremities."
    carm "What? I’m just saying, if you and the fussy ginger one weren’t so picky, we could be snuggled up in a hayloft -"
    
    "There’s a loud cough from Lafontaine."
    laf "Can the flirting wait until we’re warm, please?"
    carm "Humans are annoyingly fragile. If we can’t find a place to stay soon, you’re all going to start losing your minds, and I’d rather not have to babysit you two."
    laura "Carm!"
    perry "She’s not entirely wrong. I'm a bit worried that we’re all going to get hypothermia if this storm keeps up!"
    carm "Yes, you will, and then I’ll be forced to abandon all of you in the cold."
    laura "Carmilla!"
    
    "Carmilla and Perry are glaring at each other, and I’m about ready to step between them (again) when I heard Lafontaine calling from a few feet away."
    
    laf "Hey, I think there’s something ahead! It looks like a building."
    
    "We rush through the snow towards the vaguely rectangular shape in the distance."
    "I cling to Carm’s hand tightly despite my numb fingers, holding to her as I stumble through the snow."
    laura "It has to be a building, right? This isn’t a group hallucination."
    "When we get close enough we see it’s another farmhouse, but this one looks well-kept. The paint still looks relatively new and it’s not falling apart."
    
    laura "We’re staying here, whether anyone wants to or not."
    carm "Fine by me. You’re looking a little too cold, let’s hope there are blankets inside somewhere."
    laf "Warmth, finally!"
    
    "Once we’re inside Perry and Laf immediately start scavenging for anything we could use."
    "I hear several pleased exclamations from Lafontaine and pray that it doesn't end in any accidental fires or loss of eyebrows."
    "I pull Carm towards one corner of the farmhouse where I can see a stack of blankets, presumably for horses or cows."
    
    laura "We’ll grab some of these and head up to the hayloft, how does that sound?"
    
    carm "It sounds great, cutie."
    
    "I reach for several of the blankets and hand them over to Carm. Something shiny catches my attention and I scoop it up. It’s a little glass jar with some sort of wax figure inside."
    
    laura "Hey, look at this. It’s... kind of creepy but also weirdly kind of cute?"
    
    carm "Whatever it is, it’s useless. Come on, Laura, just leave it and we’ll go get warm, okay?"

    perry "No, Lafontaine, we’re not lighting a fire in a barn full of very flammable hay. We’re going to see if there’s any other places nearby by, or any food."
    
    laf "Yeah, we’re doing that. You two hormone bombs behave while we’re gone, please."
    
    perry "Lafontaine! Really."
    
    laf "Hey, I’m not wrong."

    "I look at the jar again before tucking it in my backpack."
    
    laura "It could be useful for something. We could always take the figure out and fill this with water or food, right?"
    
    carm "Okay, I guess. Come on, I just want to curl up with you and go to sleep."
